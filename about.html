<p>This project is maintained by L2C1x1 fans for <u title="Lineage II Chronicle 1: Harbingers of War">L2C1x1</u> fans. Many of us should have noticed that all the private servers where we used to play sooner or later get closed. This may be very upsetting, as playing on low-rates server, like x1, takes time.</p>
<p>The reasons why private servers live for a very limited period of time are <b>a)</b> too few people maintaining the project combined with <b>b)</b> very low online. These projects do not make money and exist till their admin has interest.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a new approach, to create a really long-term private server. The main idea is in accumulating people of interest, creating a community of L2C1x1 fans, sharing experience, knowledge about PTS server distributions, configurations, etc. in order to give everyone in the community an ability to help in the development of the project and, if necessary, administer it.</p>
<p>The fan-club private server was launched on <b>April 4, 2016</b>; shortly after <u>l2-firebird.tk</u> went down on April 2, 2016 02:24:53 GMT+1</p>
