<p>This project is maintained by and for <u title="Lineage II Chronicle 1: Harbingers of War">L2 C1 x1</u> fans. Many of us should have noticed, that all the private servers (the only type of server where we can find authentic C1), where we used to play, sooner or later get closed. This may be very upsetting, as playing on low-rates server, like x1, requires playing for a long period of time.</p>
<p>The reasons why private servers live for a very limited period of time are <b>a)</b> too few people maintaining the project combined with <b>b)</b> very low online. These projects do not make money and exist until their admins have interest.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a new approach, to create a really long-term private server. The main idea is in accumulating people of interest, creating a community of L2 C1 x1 fans, sharing experience, knowledge about PTS server distributions, configurations, etc., in order to give everyone in the community an ability to help in development of the project, and, if necessary, administer it.</p>
<p>The fan-club private server was launched on <b>April 4, 2016</b>; shortly after <u>l2-firebird.tk</u> went down on April 2, 2016 02:24:53 GMT+1</p>
