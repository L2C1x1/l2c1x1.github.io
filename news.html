<p class="party">Unbelievable But True</p>
<p>One year has passed since we went online. We've started to work on the project on April 2, 2016 and after only two days of work managed to open it to the public. This happened on April 4, 2016.</p>
<p>We dedicate the launch of our <a href="https://m.me/l2c1x1">facebook chatbot - Nyx</a> to this great event. We go global!</p>
<p>We're really excited you're a part of our community! As we expand, we need more and more people to join our core team (GMs, PRs, developers).</p>
<p><a href="mailto:l2c1x1fc@gmail.com">Join now!</a></p>
