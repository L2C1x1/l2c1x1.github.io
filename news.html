</p>
<p>20 months and 20 days has passed since we launched this project on April 4, 2016.</p>
<p>About <span class="party">1000</span> game accounts and more then <span class="party">1100</span> player characters were created during this period of time. 1 &dash; 2 accounts and player characters are created every day.<br/>
	Total use time (time players actively spent in the game) has exceeded <span class="party">8 years</span>.<br/>
	<span class="party">235 million</span> of adena has been farmed, total market capitalization of in-game values has reached <span class="party">980 million</span> adena.</p>
<p>Our team has already invested $ 50 000 value worth of their time into the project and this value continues to grow every day.</p>
<p>A lot of work has been done. To name just few things,</p>
