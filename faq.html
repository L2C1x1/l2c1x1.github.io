	<dt>Is this project for serious and for a long time? Can I invest my time in it safely?</dt>
	<dd>Definitely. We're targeting at least 10 years uptime for this project.</dd>

	<dt>I can see three game worlds. Which one do I chose to play?</dt>
	<dd>Choose the first one, Bartz aka Heaven. The second one (Sieghardt aka Hell) is extremely hard to play on. You may also try Kain aka Chaos, which is our test world, where everyone is a GM.</dd>

	<dt>How can I find who is online now?</dt>
	<dd>Use our <a href="api.html">Public API</a>. You will find out who is online, and much much more.</dd>

	<dt>I would like to participate in project development. How can I join your team?</dt>
	<dd>Give us a note: <a href="mailto:l2c1x1fc@gmail.com">l2c1x1fc@gmail.com</a>. Download the server from our site, play with it, learn it.</dd>

	<dt>I would like to become a GM. Can I join your GM team?</dt>
	<dd>Definitely. Give us a note and we will schedule an online interview with you.</dd>

	<dt>Do you have an in-game shop or something?</dt>
	<dd>No, and we do not plan to open one. We do not summon items, even during events. That's a part of our philosophy.</dd>

	<dt>Do you accept donations?</dt>
	<dd>Donations are appreciated, but only in a classic meaning of this term. You won't get any in-game benefits.</dd>

	<dt>Am I allowed to modify my game client?</dt>
	<dd>But we kindly ask you not to use it for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_exploit">exploiting</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_bot">botting</a> (see <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>).</dd>

	<dt>Am I allowed to use limitations of the NPCs AI?</dt>
	<dd>Yes (see <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>).</dd>

	<dt>Am I allowed to run more then one client of the game?</dt>
	<dd>Sure. You may run as many clients as you wish. The number of accounts which you use simultaneously is not limited.</dd>

	<dt>Can I share my account with a friend?</dt>
	<dd>This is not regulated by our rules. We assume your friend is acting on your behalf in that case.</dd>

	<dt>Can I exchange in-game assets for non in-game assets?</dt>
	<dd>This is not regulated by our rules and we do not provide any service for that. Double check whom you’re trading with. If the in-game assets you’re buying are farmed using exploits or bots (see <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>) we reserve the right to confiscate such assets.</dd>
