	<dt>I can see three game worlds. Which one do I chose to play?</dt>
	<dd>Chose the first one, Bartz aka Heaven. The second one (Sieghardt aka Hell) is not opened yet. You may also try Kain aka Chaos, which is our test world, where everyone is a GM.</dd>

	<dt>How can I find who is online now?</dt>
	<dd>Use our <a href="/api.html">Public API</a>. You will find out who is online, and much much more.</dd>

	<dt>I would like to participate in project development. How can I join your team?</dt>
	<dd>Give us a note: <a href="mailto:l2c1x1fc@gmail.com">l2c1x1fc@gmail.com</a>. Download the server from our site, play with it, learn it.</dd>

	<dt>I would like to become a GM. Can I join your GM team?</dt>
	<dd>Definitely. Give us a note and we will schedule an online interview with you.</dd>

	<dt>Do you have an in-game shop or something?</dt>
	<dd>No, and we do not plan to open one. We do not summon items, even during events. That's a part of our philosophy.</dd>

	<dt>Do you accept donations?</dt>
	<dd>Donations are appreciated, but only in a classic meaning of this term. You won't get any in-game benefits.</dd>

	<dt>Am I allowed to modify my game client?</dt>
	<dd>Yes, you can use any client software and any client modifications you wish. But we kindly ask you not to use it for exploiting or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_bot">botting</a>.</dd>

	<dt>Am I allowed to use limitations of the NPCs AI?</dt>
	<dd>Yes.</dd>

	<dt>Am I allowed to run more then one client of the game?</dt>
	<dd>Sure. You may run as many clients as you wish. The number of accounts which you use simultaneously is not limited.</dd>

	<dt>Can I share my account with a friend?</dt>
	<dd>This is not our business. You may share it, or even sell it. As long as you don't abuse our servers or services – we don't care.</dd>

	<dt>Can I sell or buy in-game valuables from other players?</dt>
	<dd>Again, not our business, we don't really care. However, we do care if these valuables were farmed using exploits or bots. We reserve a right to confiscate such valuables.</dd>
